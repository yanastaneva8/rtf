    "anna": "I am a new mother and a geneticist by trade, and I believe we can change our lives with knowledge and food. I love exploring and learning about health, about the interaction between genes and environment, and how we influence that through our food. The food that we eat is one of the easiest and hardest things to change, and which can produce amazing results for us. In my personal experience, food helped me with my endometriosis symptoms, to get pregnant, and to breastfeed. My strength is to simplify complex concepts and I love discovering the nuances. My goal is to help women to get pregnant and to give their babies the best possible start without losing all their own strength and ability to lead a fulfilling life. It’s rare to have a village nowadays, so let’s build our own together.",
    "yana": "I am a happy mother who experienced a completely natural home birth. I’m a mathematician by education, but I left academia prematurely before completing my PhD. My interests are mainly scientific, and my hobbies are nature-related. My favorite topics to discuss are: free will (or rather, the lack thereof), the multiverse, and natural living. I’m good at solving problems, researching, and optimizing existing solutions. I love spending time in nature with my loved ones. My main goal is to present the facts as they are. I believe it’s important to be aware of reality and to make informed decisions."
