My husband and I always wanted to have children, and when we felt the time had come, we started trying. It took us a little over two years to conceive, and when it finally happened, we were overjoyed.  

During those two years of trying (and even before that), I was deeply interested in topics around pregnancy and birth. I read and researched good practices in Bulgaria and abroad, asked friends and acquaintances about their birth experiences, and read forums and stories of strangers. So even before getting pregnant, I had already made a list of criteria for choosing where to give birth (if my and the baby’s condition allowed it, of course).  

I wanted to give birth naturally (when the baby was ready), with as few interventions as possible, in a calm and supportive environment, with the ability to move during the active phase and choose a comfortable position, to have immediate skin-to-skin contact, delayed cord clamping, breastfeeding support, and not to be separated from the baby during the hospital stay. My husband and I also wanted him to be present. I was open to the possibility of a water birth and had started exploring it, since I love water and it seemed like a very comfortable place to give birth.

Unfortunately, there aren’t many places in Bulgaria where all of that is possible, so the choice wasn’t hard — we decided on [Zebra Midwifery Practice](https://zebramidwives.com/).

During the first trimester of pregnancy, I felt very tired and often nauseous. At the beginning of the second trimester, during a routine check-up, the doctor noticed a cervical polyp that started causing bleeding, which made me quite anxious until it detached on its own around the sixth month. After that, I tried to relax and spend the third trimester preparing for birth and the baby’s arrival. Around that time, Sofia was unbearably hot, and I remember overheating constantly — I couldn’t go outside, even early in the morning, because it was still too warm.  

Instead, we used the time to attend classes about birth and newborn care, a first aid course for emergencies, lectures about breastfeeding, etc. I felt we had done everything possible to be informed and prepared, as much as one can be.  

Despite the heat, I tried to stay active, walking the dog for long walks early in the morning and late at night, and doing yoga at home.  

Throughout the pregnancy, we were told the baby was measuring bigger than average and might come earlier than the due date. I didn’t give it much importance since both my husband and I are tall and broad, and it didn’t seem unusual that our baby might be big.

> The thought of possibly being induced scared me, and I really wanted the baby to be born when it was ready.

We discussed my birth plan with the midwives — what I wanted and didn’t want to happen if I had a choice — and also the potential option for a water birth. The midwives suggested we consider having a doula with us, mainly for support during early labor at home. I was skeptical at first, but after meeting [Mira from “Dula do men”](https://duladomen.com/), I was sure I wanted her there.

So, after the August heat passed, in early September I entered my ninth month. My due date was October 3rd, and the hospital where I planned to give birth waits a week past the due date before induction. Afraid of being induced, I decided to try every “mythical” method to encourage the baby to come naturally.  

Entering the 37th week, I started eating dates and pineapple daily, taking even longer walks and doing yoga, climbing stairs. Almost whenever I was home, I sat on the birthing ball, swaying or making hip circles. Between weeks 37 and 39, I had two nights with mild, irregular contractions, which I ignored, assuming they were just preparatory.  

In the 39th week (September 27th), I went for a check-up with the midwives and asked them to check my dilation and cervical condition. I was 3 cm dilated with some effacement, so we decided to try membrane sweeping to see if labor might start. They explained it was a non-invasive method that sometimes triggers labor within a few days but doesn’t always have an effect. I figured I had nothing to lose.  

The next few days passed without much change, except that on September 28 and 29 I thought I lost my mucus plug. I knew that didn’t necessarily mean labor would start soon, so I tried to stay calm and go about my usual routine.  

We agreed with the midwives to wait until October 3rd (my due date) — if I hadn’t gone into labor by then, I would call them and go for monitoring. They, however, believed it would start before that.  

On October 1st, I woke up and felt that the baby wasn’t moving as usual. Throughout the second and third trimesters, he had been very active, moving almost constantly and always wiggling when I woke up. I waited a bit, took a shower, had breakfast, and still — no movement. I hadn’t felt him since 2 a.m., and it was already 10 a.m. Worried something might be wrong, I called the midwives and told them my husband and I were coming in to check the baby’s heart rate. In the car, I was very anxious and cried, afraid that something was truly wrong.  

Thank God, the heartbeat was normal, and the baby was fine. I took the opportunity to mention to the doctor and midwives that I’d been having intense itching on my feet. The doctor explained that such itching could be a symptom of cholestasis (a condition not to be underestimated) and suggested checking my dilation before deciding what to do.  

The examination showed I was 6 cm dilated, the baby was low, and my cervix was almost fully effaced. The doctor said that given the itching and my progress, it would be best to stay, break the waters, and give birth that same day.  

My husband and I were shocked — we had come in out of fear something was wrong, not expecting labor! We asked if I could go home to wait for contractions to start (as per my birth plan), but the doctor said labor had already begun and insisted I stay.  

For a first birth, we expected it to take much longer to reach 6 cm. It was hard for me to process it all. After discussing with the midwives, who agreed with the doctor, we decided to stay and proceed with breaking the waters.  

To this day, I don’t know if it was the right decision, but we agreed. In moments like that, it’s hard to trust your own judgment — especially for a first birth when everything is new.  

They settled me in the room where we’d later stay with the baby, while my husband went to get our bags and walk the dog, who had been left behind that morning. Alone in the room, I took a moment to process what was happening, talked to the baby in my mind, told him I loved him, and that soon I’d hold him in my arms.  

At 1:30 p.m. the midwife placed an IV, and at 2:10 p.m. we went to the birthing room and broke my waters. During the procedure, she said I was already 7–8 cm dilated, which shocked me even more since I still had no strong contractions. It only deepened my disbelief. I thought I had hours ahead of me — contractions, pain, everything we’d learned in class. I even thought it might take until the next day. I called the doula to tell her what was happening; she said she’d get ready and come, reassuring me that first labors are usually long anyway.  

The doctor insisted on a very slow oxytocin drip — something I hadn’t wanted, but at that moment I didn’t question it. Within half an hour, contractions began, regular but quite tolerable, like strong period cramps. The midwives and doctor kept checking in, asking when my husband would arrive, worried he might miss the birth. I thought they were joking.  

By 3 p.m., my husband was back, and I was doing some exercises the midwife had shown me to help progress. Suddenly, one incredibly strong contraction hit, freezing me in place. I couldn’t move or speak, only motioned to my husband to hold me.  

> The midwife kept asking how I felt, but I couldn’t talk, couldn’t think — I heard her as if from another dimension.  

When it passed, I told them it was very strong and that I couldn’t stay standing. They suggested I get on the bed on all fours, to see if that was better. I managed to get through a few more of those overwhelming contractions, feeling like I’d faint. I even said out loud, “I can’t do this.” Now, looking back, I realize that was transition — but at the time, I didn’t.  

It was unbearably hot, and I felt nauseous. Thankfully, while I was lost in the contractions, the midwives had prepared the birthing pool and invited me in. At first, the water felt too warm, but once I immersed myself, it was soothing — it helped me focus inward. On land, I felt awkward and tense; in the water, I had my own space — just me, the water, and the baby. I’m so glad I decided to get in; it truly helped relieve the intensity.  

Shortly after I entered the water, Mira arrived and began placing cold compresses on my forehead, neck, and back — they felt heavenly between contractions. The midwives and doctor started asking if I felt the urge to push. I kept thinking, “Push? Isn’t it too soon?” I even asked them several times if they were sure it was time — I still didn’t realize the baby would be born so soon.

A few contractions later, they encouraged me to try pushing, but I still didn’t feel that “irresistible” urge. It took about ten contractions for me to connect with my body, focus, and trust the process. At some point, I no longer needed guidance — everything was happening naturally. I just needed to hear that everything was fine, that the baby was okay (they checked the heartbeat with a small Doppler every few contractions), and that we were progressing.  

In the water, I felt great. I changed positions once or twice until I found the most comfortable one — squatting like a frog, holding my husband with one hand and Mira with the other. The midwives and doula kept reassuring and cheering me on. Everyone was kind and supportive — just as I had hoped. The doctor also came by occasionally to check on me and offer encouragement.  

Perhaps the hardest moment came right before the baby’s head emerged — the pressure and pain were intense.  

> Your body tries to push the baby out, while your mind resists because it means even more pain.  

In that moment, Mira’s words helped the most — she reminded me not to think about myself or the pain, but about the baby, that I had to help him come out.  

I don’t know how long I spent in the pool, but at 5:28 p.m., B. was born. They handed him to me, and my first thought was how big he was — almost 4 kg! I imagined he’d be smaller, more wrinkled. They placed him on my chest, and I held him in disbelief that he was finally here. After a few minutes, the cord was cut, and they took him for a quick check. I was given an oxytocin injection to help deliver the placenta, which came out with the next contraction — intact and healthy. They showed it to me, then helped me out of the pool and put me under light anesthesia to do the necessary stitches.

About 15 minutes later, I woke up, and Mira and I were taken to the room where my husband was waiting. Soon, they brought the baby, and Mira helped us with the first latch. It didn’t work right away — he was still very sleepy — but both she and the midwives offered invaluable guidance and support. Thanks to them, we had a successful breastfeeding start, something I really wanted.  

We spent the first night cuddling, nursing, and soaking in the joy of being together. I was euphoric and couldn’t stop staring at him all night (and for many nights after). We stayed three nights in the hospital, with the baby only leaving for morning checkups — the only time I managed to sleep a bit.  

When discharge day came, I was emotional and still couldn’t believe we’d be going home as three. I felt discomfort and pain from the stitches, but it passed after about a week, once they were removed.  

I’ll forever be deeply grateful to my husband, Mira, the midwives from Zebra, and Dr. Kobakov for helping me have a satisfying and joyful birth in the supportive environment I had dreamed of.
