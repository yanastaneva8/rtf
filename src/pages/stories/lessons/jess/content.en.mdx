This was my third pregnancy, and from the very start I knew I wanted things to be different this time. Having already experienced birth before, I carried with me not only the memories of those journeys but also a stronger sense of what I needed and what felt right for me. At my very first booking appointment with the midwife, I voiced that wish clearly: 

> I wanted a home birth. 

It felt important — a way to create a calmer, more intimate space for myself, my baby, and my family.

This pregnancy felt much easier on my body, especially after having suffered with [HG](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/related-conditions/complications/severe-vomiting/) during my last pregnancy. I carried with a little more confidence, knowing what to expect, and I found myself able to enjoy the experience in a way I hadn’t before. But it wasn’t without its challenges. Partway through, I was told I had [obstetric cholestasis (OC)](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/related-conditions/complications/itching-and-intrahepatic-cholestasis/) of the liver. Hearing that was unsettling — suddenly my calm, straightforward pregnancy had a shadow of risk hanging over it. From that point, I had blood taken every week to check my bile acid and liver levels, each test a reminder that my plans could change depending on the results.

As I reached the later weeks, my midwife and I spoke in more detail about my birth plan. We talked through where I would feel most comfortable to labour, what would help me stay calm, and how we could adapt if things changed suddenly. The home birth team were amazing in supporting my decision not to have an induction, especially as I had never carried past 37 weeks with my previous pregnancies. I trusted that the baby would come soon.

By 39 weeks, though, I was exhausted. The [PGP](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/related-conditions/common-symptoms/pelvic-pain/), the constant blood tests, the monitoring. It was all wearing me down. I was fed up and ready to meet my baby. On the day of my due date, a lovely midwife came to my home and offered me a sweep. I’d never had one before, and to be honest, I’d always been 50/50 about it. After reading so many horror stories, and being so against induction, I had believed my body would just go into labour by itself. But I agreed and within 20 minutes, contractions started.

It was a little confusing at first. In my previous births, things had begun with my waters breaking, so I’d never experienced contractions coming on like this. They began around lunchtime, slowly progressing throughout the afternoon. By 6pm, I went to my local hospital’s aromatherapy department and picked up what I like to call my little **“potion”**. I mixed it with some milk and poured it into the bath when I got home. The warm water and the scent helped me relax, giving me a small pocket of calm.

That evening, I tucked my two children into bed, and with my partner, we set everything up **birthing ball, towels, pads to catch the mess, all the little preparations** that made the space feel ready. By 11pm, my waters still hadn’t gone, but the contractions were stronger and closer together. I phoned the home birth team, and they told me to call back when things became too much to manage on my own.

By 1:30am, that moment had come. The pressure was intense, deep down in my pelvis, and I felt certain the baby was coming soon. I rang the home birth team again, but this time there was no midwife available to attend. Because of how quickly things were progressing, they called an ambulance. It wasn’t what I wanted — flashing lights and paramedics weren’t part of the calm birth I had imagined — but when the ambulance arrived just before 2am, I felt a wave of relief. I wasn’t alone anymore.

When they came, I was bent over the sofa, having just found a comfortable position (typical timing!). They offered me some [Entonox](https://www.guysandstthomas.nhs.uk/health-information/entonox-gas-and-air-endoscopy-unit), and after a few steady puffs I slowly stood up — only for my waters to break right there. My partner grabbed the bag we’d packed for an emergency. Everything suddenly felt very real. They got me straight into the ambulance, saying **Goodbye** to my aunt on the way out the door and we began what felt like the bumpiest journey of my life to the hospital.

We arrived at 2:18am, and by 2:34am I was greeted with my baby — a surprise little boy, as we hadn’t found out the gender beforehand. He was covered in meconium, having done a poo on his way out, but he was here, safe and strong.

The midwives listened to the birth plan I had written in the back of my notes, which meant so much to me. They kept my baby and placenta together for around twenty minutes before I asked for the injection to help deliver it. Funnily enough, it ended up taking longer to birth the placenta than the baby itself — thirty-six minutes for the placenta, compared to sixteen for my son!

By 10am that morning, I was showered, dressed in fresh pyjamas, and back home with my two other children. The house was calm, the chaos of the night had passed, and I finally had my baby in my arms where he belonged.

I’ll be honest — I am a little upset that I didn’t get the home birth I had planned. It’s something I don’t hear spoken about much: **the quiet grief of a birth not going the way you’d hoped, even when everything turns out well**. There were no risks to me or my baby, and I had truly believed things would unfold as I imagined. I had pictured my auntie being there along side my partner, to support me, to witness my baby coming into the world, but that wasn’t meant to be — and it wasn’t through any choice of mine.

Still, it was a beautiful experience in its own right. My little boy arrived safely, and I felt heard, respected, and supported by the home birth team throughout my pregnancy and labour, even though we didn’t make it to birthing at home. Their care and compassion felt much deeper than anything I’d experienced from community midwives before. If I were ever to have another child, I would absolutely plan for a home birth again. And I would 100% recommend it.
