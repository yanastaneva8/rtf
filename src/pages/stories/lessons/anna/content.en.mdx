I spent a lot of years thinking I didn't want to have children or rather not really thinking about it and just “going with the flow”. After years at university when I finished my PhD, I realised something in my life was missing and I wanted to have a family. My husband and I decided to get married and try to get pregnant. At the time I wasn't prepared for pregnancy and I had had surgery for endometriosis the previous year. This had prompted me to start a journey of getting to know my body better and take better care of myself. I restricted the processed foods to a minimum and started sourcing food from the local farmer’s market. My diet consisted of liver, beef, pork, chicken, eggs, local fruit and vegetables in mainly home cooked food. I had stopped any tobacco, THC, alcohol, and greatly reduced the amount of coffee. I was also tracking my cycle and felt in tune with my body. I was meditating, doing yoga and lifting weights, I was doing breathwork every day. At that point we started trying for a baby and after a few short months, I was pregnant. I knew something was different because I knew I had ovulated and about a week later I had seen a very mild spotting. After a couple of weeks I realised my period was getting late and my breasts were unusually heavy. I almost couldn’t believe I was pregnant because I had thought it was going to take a while because of the endometriosis.

At this point I started educating myself about pregnancy, staying healthy and what to expect. I persisted with the yoga, meditations and breathwork and walking a lot every day.

We were both so excited, I wanted to go and have a scan to see the baby. So we got a scan at around 8 weeks privately.

I decided to get registered with the midwifery unit and start tracking my pregnancy. I must say this was me going with the flow again. 

Registering with care through the NHS in Scotland and UK means that you meet with a midwife around 12 weeks of pregnancy and you get an assessment which determines if you are low (stay in midwife care) or high (obstetrician care) risk. I was low risk and was staying under midwife care. We did blood tests for iron, leukocytes in blood, standard and I was given lots of leaflets about food, a book on what to expect in pregnancy and after baby comes and a schedule with appointments to check on me and baby. Around this time we went to Bulgaria to visit family and I got the fetal morphology scan with a gynecologist there that I had seen the previous year. It felt good to see the baby. We did another scan in the UK when we got back and the 20 week morphology scan when we decided to find out the sex. I declined the DTaP vaccine that is recommended during pregnancy. At that first NHS appointment I became aware of the home birth option. Suddenly this whole new world opened up - I had never thought this was an option before. I decided that was what we were going for. I was afraid of going to the hospital because of my childhood experiences and wanted to avoid it. I switched to the home birth team around 16 weeks and after that I had the same midwife. I was hoping that she would be on shift when I went into labour, but it could have been any midwife from the home birth team.

I started preparing for a home birth. I read a lot of books on pain and fear in childbirth, listened to birth stories from women, watched videos of women giving birth at home.

My pregnancy was a very enjoyable experience, I did have a little bit of nausea for a few weeks but nothing too uncomfortable. I exercised every day, walked a lot and signed up for a pregnancy yoga class. I was a little bit reserved talking to many people about my home birth plans. A colleague of mine, seeing the book on natural birth I was reading, commented that I should not have my hopes up and that really annoyed me at the time. There weren’t many people around me who had had home births. The midwife was reassuring but maybe it was because I couldn’t choose who I had for my care that made me a bit uneasy.

I ignored the medical advice on food I was given - which is to avoid liver, cod liver oil because of the high vitamin A content. I kept following the diet I had followed until then because I felt good on it. I was working full time and we were planning our wedding. We decided to get married before the baby arrived.

Around 20 something weeks we had a work event with visitors and everyone in the office got ill with covid. I felt fine initially but later came down with some gastric symptoms for a couple of days. Didn’t test for covid, but stayed at home for a few days and rested. Around 30 weeks I had some spotting and ended up going to maternity care to get checked. There was nothing wrong with baby but they did fetal monitoring and urine tests. The doctor prescribed an antibiotic for potential UTI because I had been going to the bathroom more often and there were leukocytes in my urine. I didn’t think I had an UTI, however I decided to take the antibiotics. Looking back, I thought the baby was pressing on my bladder and I was drinking dandelion tea, which is a diuretic. I stopped the tea and my symptoms went away after a couple of weeks. I might have needed more rest in that time as with work and the wedding I was stressed out. I had booked all my holidays before the start of my maternity leave which I was starting a month before my “due date” so I got two months off work before baby arrived.

Baby seemed to be low in my belly from around 32-33 weeks. Well, 38 weeks came and went. 39 weeks came and went, so did 40 and 41. I was starting to get antsy and was also very big and heavy and walking was getting difficult. I knew I didn't want an induction and we were waiting for baby. 

On Wednesday of that week we went out for dinner, had a walk in the evening and had a lovely night. 

On Thursday I woke up at 4-5am with mild contractions. I was excited and a bit freaked out. I tried to go back to bed and relax. The contractions kept coming and were mild and in the morning my mucus plug came out. I had booked a pregnancy massage that day and thought I still wanted to go depending on how things were moving. The contractions were continuing but stayed mild so I decided to go. I went and had my massage and the contractions kept coming while I was having it and I felt like I could relax. After that my husband and I went back home and had food and chilled out. I was trying to ignore the sensations and not focus too much on them, however I could tell they were getting stronger and more frequent. The contractions kept coming and getting stronger and I did some light yoga to help me pass the time. In hindsight, I wish I spent that day just relaxing at home and not gone out for a massage.

My husband was with me and brought me food and drinks and tried to help me feel comfortable with hot water bottles and whatever I wanted.
In the evening I was feeling more and more uncomfortable as I was getting the contractions sensation in my back which I was unprepared for. 

## Night 1

I had a bath and showers to help with the pain. After midnight I decided to call the midwife because I thought the contractions were frequent and strong. She came over but it wasn’t the midwife I knew. She seemed nice and I agreed to a vaginal exam as I wanted to know how far along I was. In hindsight I wish I didn’t call the midwife and didn’t get an exam but just kept going at home. Now I understand if baby was not in the “right” position this could have been pre-labour needed for her to get into optimal position. She told me I was 2cm dilated and my cervix was soft and low down so I was progressing but I shouldn’t worry and instead I should rest. She also said that baby’s head is sideways and maybe not pushing on the cervix as strongly as if she’d been if she was facing back. After hearing that I thought my contractions spaced out a bit. So I tried to rest and sleep but I was having contractions every 10 min and they were strong enough to keep me awake. 

## Day 2

The whole of the next day the contractions kept coming but things didn’t escalate. We just spent the day hanging out watching tv and having food at home. I tried to relax and did some light yoga. Another night went by the same way where I couldn't sleep with contractions every 10 minutes or so. And the whole time I was feeling them in my back. I tried lying down using the Bradley method but my back was too sore for that. Standing in the shower, squatting or lunging felt more comfortable. I had a bath and that helped me relax a bit more and eased the pain. We had our birth pool inflated but I didn't feel like it was time to fill it up.

## Day 3

On Saturday things started to get more intense and closer together again. I needed more attention on the sensations and more comforts. My back pain was intense and I spent a lot of time in the shower and bath trying to find a comfortable position.
At some point we noticed I was having difficulties peeing. The only way I could do it was like a frog on the puppy pad on the floor. After that I tried again but couldn’t. I tried every possible position we could think of in and out of the shower, in the bath, squatting, frog, turned back on the toilet and nothing worked. I was getting a bit worried. And my back pain was getting a lot more intense. Around 5pm we called the midwife and it was the same one that had come on Thursday night. I agreed to get checked and I was 6cm. I was happy I had progressed. But I couldn't pee. The midwife also wasn’t happy about my blood pressure and baby’s heart rate was high. She said she didn’t recommend us staying at home and we should get transferred to the hospital. We thought about it a bit but we were both not comfortable going against her advice at that time and I knew I needed some way to get relieved from my full bladder. So we decided to transfer to the hospital. Baby was still in the same position - I knew that because I knew she hadn’t changed position since Thursday. I believed my BP and baby’s heart rate were high because of my bladder.
My husband, the midwife and I were all in the ambulance. We had a quick ambulance transfer (under 10 minutes) which was very uncomfortable. In the hospital my husband was with me. We got a birthing suite that was made nice with lights and a diffuser. However because of the high blood pressure readings and baby’s heart rate they put me on continuous monitoring. That was annoying and made me uncomfortable. It was hard to argue and advocate while having contractions, wanting to relax and dealing with pain. It also meant I couldn’t get in the shower which was my comfort at home. We just had all the NHS hospital stuff - IV, lots of people coming in, doctors interrupting etc. Things were progressing though and after a few hours the midwife asked if she could check me and I was now 7-8cm. I wanted to get a catheter put in because I had tried and tried to go to the bathroom and just couldn’t, so when they did they got about 1L out!! The relief was huge and I think that’s when things progressed a little. My blood pressure readings were ok and baby’s heart rate had normalised but they wouldn’t remove the constant monitoring. In hindsight, I wish I argued for intermittent monitoring so I could go in the shower.

My waters were still intact and then they started asking about breaking them but I refused.

There was a point where they wanted to put an extra IV in my other arm and suddenly these other hospital staff were in the room. This nurse was holding my hand while they were trying to put the IV even though I asked them not to and said they couldn't put it in my left arm. It failed so this whole thing was a waste of time and distracted me from my labour land. I hated that. At one point I stood up from the bed and my waters broke. It was another relief. But the contractions did get more intense and still in my back. My husband kept pressing on my back and that gave me relief. I spent most of the time standing up from the bed. Baby was not turning however. 

## Night 3

They suggested we get oxytocin to try and encourage the baby to turn. For some reason I agreed even though I didn’t want the oxytocin. I thought it might work and get things moving quicker.
These were the worst contractions ever, on the oxytocin. They were many times stronger than my own ones. I had decided to take the gas and air for comfort but I have to say it doesn’t work on the pain but it’s a bit distracting from it. In hindsight I wouldn’t take it and try to rely on my pain relief methods. I was so set on having the home birth I never prepared well for the eventuality of going to the hospital so I was surprised by it. It was hard not having anyone there besides my husband to advocate for me or explain to me what’s going on etc. I wish I had a doula at this point to call instead of the midwife who I did not know. I wish I had prepared more for the eventuality of going to hospital and being clear on what I wanted there. But we were a bit scared. I wish I could trust my body and baby more.
The oxytocin did encourage the baby to turn but she turned sunny side up and my back pain never went away. It became more intense. I also had to have a catheter again (one attempt failed because a student midwife was doing it. At the time that was not clear to me otherwise I would have declined the student).

## Day 4

By now it’s the early hours on Sunday. The shift changed again and a new doctor came in. I had been having these HUGE oxy contractions that felt like my uterus was pushing down. I had some bleeding and I just wanted the hormone drip off. I remember shaking and feeling scared. I had tried to lie on my side with a peanut ball but it was too painful. My husband was exhausted and he was having a nap on the chair in the room while I tried to rest.

I wanted to get checked and was 9cm according to the doctor and I hated the sensation this time. I had been standing up all night with intense contractions and no food apart from a few oatcakes. The whole time I had been thinking she would have come by now. I thought we would be there for a few hours, they would get the catheter and it will go quickly but it didn’t go like that. 

At that point the doctor suggested we go for a c-section because she thought my uterus might be too tired after all the 4 days of contracting. I was so sad. I was talking to my husband and crying and I knew I couldn't do it any more. I also felt I couldn't get her out myself at this point. In hindsight I do wonder if I was in transition then. At the time I did think I could not do another day with contractions, no food and more catheters in. So we decided to go with the c-section. I liked the new doctor. I felt she understood it was important to me. The main thing she said was that I’d be a great candidate for a VBAC. I have to say the staff were all very nice from the moment we got there. They were supportive of me and tried to encourage me and help me. I didn’t feel forced into the c-section.

So we did the c-section, my husband was there with me. We talked to the doctor to have immediate skin to skin. I wanted to get the placenta out with baby and not cut it at all. Initially they didn’t agree to it so we agreed on delayed cord clamping. However, what actually happened was that the placenta had come out with baby and they had clamped but not cut the cord. So I got my lotus birth in the end. She came to me right away for skin to skin. That wait when they opened me and before I heard her cry was the scariest and longest in my life. And then she was there - a big beautiful healthy baby girl put on my chest. I was so happy to meet her and so sad she had to come this way. I felt like I failed. But she was there and healthy and I did not let her go for hours and hours. She slept on my chest and fed after a while. I didn’t let them weigh my baby for hours. I cut the cord eventually. It was so precious to just hold her against my chest and not let her go.

My big baby girl, born 4.282kg.
