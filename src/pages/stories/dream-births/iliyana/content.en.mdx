## My Two Birth Stories

Hello everyone, my name is Iliyana. I’m the mom of two girls — one is almost five, and the other is just over a year.

With both of them, I can honestly say I had pretty positive birth experiences. I’d love to share my stories with other moms who might find inspiration and reassurance that even with a home birth, and without any painkillers, it’s all possible. You really can trust your own body—it was meant to give birth. That’s the nature of being female.

## My First Birth – A.

I was pregnant with my first daughter, A., when I was 30 (I got pregnant just before turning 29). I had a relatively easy pregnancy: no nausea, no major issues. I’ve always been quite active, training more or less every day, and I continued exercising throughout pregnancy. Since it was my first child, I was careful and modified a lot of exercises, using lighter weights.

This was during COVID. I got pregnant in January, and by March, the pandemic had hit. Most of the time, it was just me and my husband. We had just moved to the Netherlands—new country, no family, no friends — so we spent most of my pregnancy in lockdown.

In the Netherlands, you’re assigned a midwife instead of a gynecologist, so I did all my regular checks with her. From the very beginning, I wanted a natural birth. No cesarean, no painkillers. What really helped cement that in my mind was a birthing course my husband and I did one weekend, with other expecting parents.

The instructor explained everything: what happens in a woman’s body during birth, how to breathe, which exercises help, and how the partner can support. She broke down myths, gave us facts, and helped me frame the process with the right mindset. I also watched countless YouTube videos of other moms’ natural birth stories. Hearing them share gave me courage and focus — I didn’t want fear of pain to dominate my experience.

At 39 weeks and 5 days, my water broke. It was a Wednesday, around 5:30 p.m. I called my midwife right away. She checked me but I had no contractions or dilation yet, so she told me to wait at home. By 9:00 p.m., contractions had started — strong, frequent, mostly in my lower back.

The midwife came to check again: still only 1.5 cm dilated. She told me to try hot water for the pain, so I basically lived in the shower for hours, with my husband lying on the bathroom floor trying to support me. My mom, who had just arrived from abroad to help, stayed downstairs, listening to me scream.

At some point, I felt the urge to poop — something I later learned was the baby pressing down. I called the midwife again. She rushed over, examined me, and told me I was fully dilated. There was no time to go to the hospital. 
>“If we try, you’ll give birth in the car,” she said. 
She grabbed her equipment from the car, set everything up in our living room, and reassured me everything would be fine.

I tried different positions — on my knees, on all fours — before finding one that worked: one leg lifted, one arm resting on the sofa. That position, with gravity helping, made pushing easier. I’d learned in the course that lying flat on your back works against gravity, and I really believe this change made my labor faster.

From the moment I started pushing, A. was born in just eight minutes. My water had broken at 5:30 p.m., and at 1:46 a.m., she was in my arms — healthy, 3.295 kg.

The midwife gave me oxytocin to deliver the placenta, and I only needed one stitch. Breastfeeding was tough at first — my nipples are slightly inverted — so it took almost 10 days of effort before A. latched well. But we made it.

My first birth, though unexpected as a home birth, was a positive and empowering experience.

## My Second Birth – T.

With my second pregnancy, things were even easier. I barely modified my training routine, mostly because I already had a four-year-old to run after. I exercised until the very last day.

About 8 days before my due date, I started spotting. I called my midwife, sent her photos, and she said it could go two ways: I’d either give birth that night, or I’d need to go to the hospital in 24 hours to check the fluid.

At around 11:30 p.m., I woke up with very strong, very frequent contractions. The pain was different this time: instead of my lower back, my entire belly was tightening like a rock. The contractions came on fast.

I called the midwife, and she came immediately, this time bringing along a maternity nurse for extra support. By 1:30 a.m., I felt the urge to push. I tried the same position as my first birth, but it didn’t feel right. The midwife suggested squatting at the corner of the sofa, with my elbows resting on it.

It all went very fast — my entire labor lasted just about 2.5 hours from start to finish. Within four minutes of pushing, my second daughter was born. She weighed 3.4 kg, and this time I didn’t need any stitches at all.

There was a short scare, though. She didn’t cry right away. She came out purple, with fluid in her lungs. The midwife immediately massaged her chest and legs, while another midwife urged my husband to cut the cord quickly. They called an ambulance, which arrived in just minutes, but by then my midwife had cleared her lungs. Soon after, my baby cried and latched on immediately.

Even though we had that terrifying moment, everything ended well. I delivered the placenta, and both baby and I were safe. By the time the ambulance left, I was already up, showered, and walking around. The midwife was in shock at how fast I recovered.

## Final Thoughts

**Looking back, both births were unique but deeply positive. I’m convinced that preparation, information, and the right mindset made all the difference.**

Every birth is different, but if I could give one piece of advice to new moms, it would be this: the more informed you are, and the more positive stories you hear, the more confident and comfortable you’ll feel. Trust your body. It was made for this.

And if you can record your birth from start to finish, like we did with both my births, you will cherish this memory for life.
