B. was born on his due date. At 8 a.m. on the first day of school. Without an epidural, with lots of pain and excitement.

Two doctors had predicted that a natural birth would be impossible because of my small pelvis and the baby’s large size.

> They told me the baby would be around 3.5 kg, but in fact he was born 3.05 kg — a big difference that could have been the reason for me to undergo surgery.

I am very happy that I read [Olga Dukat](https://www.olgadukat.com)’s book, which prepared me for the birth and filled me with optimism and the desire to give birth naturally, even when everything around me seemed to be leading toward a C-section. Almost all my close relatives, friends, and colleagues had given birth by C-section, which seemed very strange and worrying to me, so I chose Olga specifically to support my birth. I wanted to be sure I would give birth with a specialist who supports natural birth.

The due date came and I still didn’t feel anything, but I was prepared to wait even beyond the term. However, after we went to bed, I felt tightening and releasing of my belly at equal long intervals. My husband suggested we leave for Sofia (we are from Plovdiv), and so we did.

During the trip my waters broke, so we were sure labor was underway. When we arrived in Sofia and went to Olga for an exam, she found I was 4 cm dilated and warned me that there was still a long time before active labor.

I chose to return to the hotel because I didn’t want to stay in the hospital. Olga went to take her little girl to her first day of school, planning to return before I entered active labor.

But that didn’t happen, because 30 minutes after the exam, in the hotel room, I was already squatting and knew I had reached those 10 cm.

We returned to the hospital, where I gave birth in 30 minutes with an episiotomy performed by another doctor on Olga’s team.

The whole birth lasted about 9 hours — extremely fast and relatively smooth.

I wish this for every mother!
