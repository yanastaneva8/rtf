I'm ready to share with the world the true story of my daughter's birth, in all its shades, without holding anything back. Many of my closest people still haven’t heard it like this—raw and unfiltered. Yes, it’s not what they might find comfortable or want to hear, but it *is* the Truth. In Bulgaria, this is still a taboo topic, something people whisper about. But I believe it’s time for women to wake up and recognize their power—to understand that birth is a physiological process and that no one needs to tell you how and when to breathe or push.

I’ve dreamed of a home birth since my teenage years. And when I found out I was pregnant, I couldn’t imagine it any other way. The cozy atmosphere, the peace, the quiet... I had no hesitation—just a deep, unwavering knowing that this would be the best for me and the soul I was about to welcome into the world.

My husband reacted strongly when I told him. He had the usual fears:

> But what if something goes wrong?

He must’ve seen the calm certainty in my eyes, but it definitely took a lot of conversations and time for him to warm up to the idea. He heard the stories of many families who had gone down this path, and we connected with couples who had chosen the same for their family and were preparing to give birth at home.

One day, he came to me and said:

> I trust you. I’m with you.

I’ll never forget his first words after the birth:

> There’s no more beautiful feeling than welcoming your child into this world!

I’d say my pregnancy was very smooth and pleasant—aside from a little nausea in the first month and a lot of sleepiness, which I gave into when I could, since I worked until the third month. I know the exact date of conception—it was a magical night. Our daughter was conceived at [Hotel Finlandia](https://www.hotelfinlandia.com/bg/) (in the Rhodope Mountains, during the Rozhen Folklore Festival).

A month later, I took a pregnancy test in Finland. It was so emotional. On our anniversary, I woke up at 5:27am with butterflies in my stomach. I took the test, and those were the longest five minutes of my life! I saw the two lines and started jumping from joy! I stuck the test onto the last page of a photo journal album I had been preparing as a gift for my husband B. In it, I had told the story of how we met and other special moments. I titled the last chapter:
**The day we found out we were becoming parents**.

Meanwhile, B. was up and brushing his teeth. I waited for him on the balcony and gave him the album. He slowly flipped through it, savoring every memory—crying and laughing. I was bursting with anticipation, waiting for that final page. He opened it, blinked several times:

> Whaaat? Really?! Are you serious?!

He hugged me tight and showered me with kisses. We couldn’t stop smiling. And so, our adventure began.

Our lives changed. We became more conscious about many things. For the past year, we’d both been eating high-quality food, avoiding cigarettes and alcohol, and staying physically active. I grounded myself and spent time in the sun. Natural medicine had become a daily practice I loved.

When I stopped working, my entire perception of the world shifted dramatically. Everyone was telling me to work as long as possible, that it wasn’t a problem. But B. insisted I stop as early as possible—since I’m a hairdresser—to avoid breathing in chemicals. I completed my university internship at a winery in Varna, and once I returned to Sofia, I went on medical leave. I postponed the ultrasound as long as I could, but again, at B.'s urging, we had the first scan in the fourth month.

I did prenatal yoga and took daily walks. I didn’t use the elevator my entire pregnancy, even though we live on the 7th floor. I made a real effort to prepare for the **natural birth marathon**.

Overall, my labor went smoothly. Contractions started on March 30th. I was getting ready for bed when I felt a strong sexual desire. B. was editing photos on the computer, so I took some time for myself. I showered and lay down. Just as I started to drift off, I felt something. I remember thinking with curiosity:

> Is that a contraction?

I kept lying there trying to fall asleep, but the contractions woke me up every 30 to 60 minutes. By morning, they had eased up—maybe one every two to three hours. I saw a spot of blood on my underwear and thought:

> It’s starting.

It was a sunny day. We went grocery shopping and had a picnic in the park. I walked very slowly and awkwardly. During contractions, I leaned on my husband—what must people around us have thought?! Haha.

That evening, the contractions picked up again. I barely slept, but we lay cuddled, full of anticipation for what was coming.

The next day, I got a craving for pancakes, so we took another slow and funny stroll, stopping during every contraction. Once home, the contractions got stronger. I just kept thinking how I didn’t want our baby to be born on April Fools’ Day—no one would believe her birthday! B. stayed by my side the whole time, supporting me through contractions, timing them, and making me laugh in between. I asked him what time it was:

> 11:58 PM.

> “Oh, thank God,” I sighed. “Now I give myself permission to give birth!”

And bam—if I’d thought the contractions were strong before, this one was something else! I moved to the yoga ball, breathed deeply, turned inward, vocalized, let my instincts take over. My mind felt foggy—I couldn’t analyze anything. I kept repeating one Bible verse:

**"I can do all things through Him who strengthens me.”**
That thought lifted me up. It gave me peace. I knew I wasn’t alone.

I got into the birthing pool. The warm water relieved me. Soon, I felt the urge to push. I felt the head—but then it slipped back, like it got sucked in. It confused me. I didn’t know that was normal. I later learned that this helps prevent tearing, because the perineum muscles need time to stretch. It happened again… and again… and then the head emerged. I caught it with my hand. B. came over, pulled my hair back gently, and whispered:

> Go on, just a bit more—she’s beautiful!

And in the next moment, she was in my arms. A tiny, perfect flower—3.3 kg, 51 cm. I welcomed her with the words:

> You did amazing, my love!

Our bodies are wise. They’ve known how to give birth for thousands of years—and they still know now.
