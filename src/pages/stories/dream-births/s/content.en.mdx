description: 'A powerful homebirth after hospital trauma'
--- 

This was my fourth pregnancy and third birth, due in the summer. My previous babies were born in hospital — I had been risked out of a birth centre because of defects detected in my first baby, which weren’t genetic, but had shown up on ultrasound. It was hard for me, because I never wanted to birth in a hospital.

During my second birth, the hospital staff almost killed us both and performed procedures without my consent. That trauma stayed with me, and for a long time I was terrified of getting pregnant again.

I knew birth wasn’t supposed to be like that. Yet, every woman I spoke to who birthed in a hospital told me they’d been traumatised too.

Originally, I wanted to freebirth because I didn’t trust private midwives either. I had been doing my own prenatal care and organising my own scans. But my partner at the time wasn’t comfortable with the idea as he had absorbed a lot of fear from others. So I compromised, and at 27 weeks I found a true midwife. She fully trusted women and was happy to support those who declined every test. We agreed she would only be called when labour started and would simply wait in my living room unless I asked her into my space.

Weeks passed. Forty weeks came and went. Then 41 weeks. I thought babies came earlier the more you had, but not this time. I had been using evening primrose oil nightly. For two weeks the baby’s head had been pressing so low that I could barely pee sitting down, and I cried often, wondering if my body would ever go into labour on its own. My previous births had all been induced.

Finally, at 41+2, at 11:22 p.m., I woke to the feeling of a balloon popping - my waters had broken in a huge gush, soaking the bed where my 2-year-old was sleeping beside me. I texted my partner, who was in another room playing video games, to bring towels so I didn’t have to move my son into the wet patch. After a shower I tried to go back to sleep, knowing labour doesn’t always start straight away. But soon, light surges began.

By 2 a.m. contractions became regular, and I set up my room with a waterproof blanket, yoga ball, and hypnobirthing tracks. Labour wasn’t yet intense, so I went to spend time with my partner, but he was still absorbed in his game. I returned to my son, nursed him back to sleep, which made contractions stronger, and stayed close to him.

This whole time I had to wear adult diapers, because with every contraction there was another big gush of waters. I worried about the idea of a “dry birth,” as people say they are more painful.

Things picked up around 3:30–4 a.m. I was breathing through contractions and asked my partner to put the TENS machine on my back. He did, but then went back to his game. Around 4:30 I asked him to sit with me, but after two contractions he went to sleep on the couch.

By 5:30 my son woke up, so I switched from hypnobirthing tracks to movies on my phone to keep him entertained. That worked for half an hour before he started crying. Normally he’d nurse at that time, but breastfeeding through contractions was too overwhelming. Despite showing him birth videos beforehand, the reality still upset him. I was struggling to stay in the zone with the noise.

Frustrated, I threw things at my partner until he woke and finally called the midwife and photographer. I didn’t want them there yet, I felt annoyed and just wanted everyone to leave. The distractions even slowed my contractions. But I had paid for a birth photographer, and I didn’t want to lose those moments.

The midwife arrived at 6:45 a.m., checked the baby’s heart once, then went quietly to the living room as we’d agreed. But instead of calming my son, my partner let him sit and cry. Looking back, I wish I’d asked my housemate to take him, but in labour your brain doesn’t always think clearly. In the end, I asked him to call my mum even though she had always been against homebirth.

At 7:15 a.m. my contractions shifted from pulling upward to pushing downward. I undressed, knowing the baby was close. My partner fetched the midwife, scared of what was happening, but she respected my wishes and simply sat silently in the corner.

On my knees on the bed, I began to push around 7:20. I breathed through most of the contractions, not wanting to tear like I had before with a big baby (4.49 kg). Finally, I pushed twice: once for his head, once for his shoulders. Being a big baby, he didn’t just slide out  but at 7:26 a.m., my son was born.

He took a minute to cry, but I was the first to hold him and rub his back. I was so grateful, because in hospital they would have cut the cord and taken him away. The placenta came 30 minutes later, and we left the cord intact for a full hour.

Nobody touched us. No tests, no rushing.

Afterwards, I showered, then hugged my 2-year-old for the first proper time in months. My new baby was weighed to be 4.6 kg (10.2 lbs), 56 cm long. I had only a superficial tear, more like a paper cut.

✨ After trauma and fear, I finally had the birth I longed for — in my own home, on my own terms. ✨
