These are just some of the things I heard during my pregnancy when I shared my plans for an unassisted birth. But I was ready to take full responsibility for both my body and my baby. I had done my homework: my body was in a great physical shape, I had worked through my biggest fears and traumas, and I was in a good mental space.


I started researching birth-related topics well before we stopped using contraception (or, to put it another way, before we started trying to conceive). I enrolled in an online course by English midwife and doula [Saima Kara](https://www.livewildbirthfree.com), began reading everything I could get my hands on, watched videos, dug into scientific papers, and read various books. That’s when I came across [Lily Nichols](https://lilynicholsrdn.com) and her book *Real Food for Pregnancy* (which I will soon translate in Bulgarian for [Iztok-Zapad](https://iztok-zapad.eu)). I found it not only thoroughly researched and well-written but an essential read for every woman—whether pregnant, trying to conceive, postpartum, or beyond. I wanted to prepare as thoroughly as possible before even getting pregnant so that I could fully enjoy the experience.

The first thing I researched was how long it takes the body to clear out substances like nicotine, caffeine, alcohol, THC, CBD, and others. Of course, this depends on one’s metabolism and levels of exposure. But there’s one fact that stands firm: it takes around 90 days, or 3 months, for both egg and sperm to fully mature. (Lily Nichols mentions this, too.) So my husband D. and I agreed that after my birthday at the end of January, we’d quit everything for at least three months.

I myself was born by C-section. Deep down, I believed there was a reason nature had made birth long, difficult, and painful. I wanted to understand that. My mother had been told that due to her high myopia, the pushing stage of labor might cause retinal detachment. But when I looked into this, I found a [paper](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6812470/) by Polish researchers that completely debunked this theory. Later on I came across the following statement - high intraocular pressure is an actual contraindication for vaginal birth. I looked into it as well and found this [paper](https://www.immunopathol.com/Inpress/ipp-39478.pdf) which shows no evidence either.

So I dug deeper. I read countless birth stories—natural births in hospitals, C-sections, assisted births, home births—and eventually found unassisted home birth stories. What struck me was that none of these stories mentioned *pushing* in the conventional sense. They spoke about something called the **fetal ejection reflex**.

As it turns out, the female body (shockingly!) is designed to push the baby out on its own. I thought: *Well, then there’s no point in worrying about my shortsightedness.* Still, I went to see an ophthalmologist before we started trying to conceive. He confirmed that I had no issues with intraocular pressure. That gave me even more confidence in my body and in nature’s design.

Once I had addressed the physical aspects of preparing for a natural birth, I turned to my mental health. I looked for a therapist experienced in working with pregnant women and found [Yana Haralanova](https://nishkite.bg). I often say the hardest step in healing is simply booking that first appointment. That’s what I did, and during our first session, we began exploring the trauma of my own birth.

It had been a scheduled C-section because my mother was over 35 and had high myopia. She was admitted to the hospital two weeks before her due date. Her water broke—which, by the way, naturally replenishes every few hours. Nothing happened for a while, and with the staff’s shift ending at Sheynovo (one of many public hospitals in Sofia, Bulgaria dedicated to women’s health and childbirth), that was apparently reason enough for a quick C-section.

My mother remembers nothing from the first few months postpartum. She told me that when she first saw me, I looked like a mouse—ugly, but with a perfectly shaped head. She was told she couldn’t breastfeed. They separated us so she could "rest." I was taken to a room with other babies who had also been separated from their mothers. Though I don’t consciously remember this, I’m sure we were all crying for our mothers.

Throughout my life, I’ve carried a deep sense of not being enough. That I couldn’t finish what I started. Add to that my parents’ separation after my father physically abused my mother when I was 6 or 7, and it’s clear there was some healing to do.

Fast forward to my preconception period: several months of complete sobriety—no caffeine, no sugar, no alcohol, no processed foods, no substances at all.

 I stayed active, ate nutrient-dense food, soaked up sunlight, walked barefoot in the mountains, and got plenty of rest. D. and I traveled to Greece, hiked Mount Mytikas, and later went to Lefkada.

Figs, lemons, seafood, moussaka, yogurt, sun, sea, kite surfing. When we got back to Sofia, we attended the wedding of two close friends—L&C. I had no desire to drink. A few days later, I had a positive pregnancy test. I knew the exact date of conception.

My pregnancy was wonderful. No nausea, no vomiting, no cramps—just the need for more sleep, which I honored. I ate more eggs and liver than usual. I didn’t take any supplements. I usually had yogurt within 20–30 minutes of waking up (which I still do by the way), followed by eggs. I ate most of my food during the day and had a light dinner. I went to bed after sunset. I did yoga, went hiking, and even set a personal record climbing Cherni Vrah (the highest peak of our home mountain Vitosha). I paid monthly for blood tests for key nutrients—every result came back in the upper half of the recommended ranges.

I knew I needed some paperwork from a gynecologist to qualify for maternity leave, so I began looking for someone who would respect my wish not to have any ultrasounds. Most refused. “We can’t confirm pregnancy without an ultrasound,” they’d say. I was frustrated. Ultrasound technology has only been around since the 1950s. Surely there are other ways to confirm pregnancy? Eventually, I let the search go.

I later found good reviews for [Dr. Dimitar Papukchiev](https://superdoc.bg/lekar/dimitar-papukchiev) on the BG Mamma forum. I booked an appointment in my sixth month—by then, my belly would speak for itself.

Around week 20, I agreed to one fetal screening—for D.'s peace of mind. I already knew everything was fine. I’d read a lot about ultrasounds, their benefits and risks. I would keep the baby no matter what, but I appreciated D.'s perspective: 
>Let’s do one screening, just to check organ development. I trust you completely. 

I booked with [Prof. Dimitar Markov](https://en.markovs.bg/prof-dimitеr-markov). When he asked who my OB was, I replied nervously: “Dr. Papukchiev.” No surprises—everything looked great.

By the third trimester, winter had arrived. We spent weekends in the mountains. D. would ski, and I’d hike. I loved sunbathing my belly and rubbing snow on it—pure bliss.

In the 8th month, I felt the baby flip head-down. I **knew** it. I had become that attuned to my body and to hers.

I had another ophthalmology exam to be sure about the intraocular pressure, as pregnancy can bring changes. Everything was fine. I got a medical note saying I was clear for a natural birth.

A week before the due date (I had one from Papukchiev, another from Markov, a third from my own calculations, and a fourth from my best friend M.), we were again on Vitosha. D. was ski touring; I hiked. A route that usually took 20–30 minutes took me over an hour. I didn’t care—I was moving.

All the due dates came and went. I stayed calm, deeply trusting the wisdom of my body. But something had shifted—I felt a need to slow down and rest. I noticed a small spot of blood in my underwear. I wasn’t sure if it was the mucus plug or dilation starting, but I knew my body was asking me to pause. I listened.

I had already researched hospital options — the [Zebra midwives](https://zebramidwives.com), [Olga Dukat](https://www.olgadukat.com)—but none of them felt as right as the comfort of our home. Still, I had a birth plan in case a transfer was needed.

## A.'s birthday
At 4:20 a.m., I woke up with what turned out to be my first contraction. I went to the bathroom, then back to bed. Ten minutes later, another wave. I moved to the living room to let D. sleep. I sat on the gym ball, breathing deeply through each surge. My breath carried me.

At 7 a.m., I downloaded a contraction-timing app. They were getting closer.

By 7:30, D. woke up. He brought me snacks—lukanka, biscuits, broth—and moved me to the bedroom. I kept breathing on the gym ball. Curtains drawn. It felt sacred. By 10 a.m., the contractions were intense—40 times worse than any period pain I’d ever felt.

I alternated between hot showers and cat-cow stretches. I couldn’t imagine being strapped to a hospital bed.

We had planned for a water birth, but none of the adapters fit the faucet. I felt relief—this was the one thing *not* going to plan, and that was okay.

At one point, I felt the baby drop. I moved between sitting on the toilet and the shower. D. breathed with me, kneeling in front of me.

At 2 p.m., I heard him say: “We need to move you from the toilet so the baby doesn’t fall in.”

He helped me on a chair in the shower, legs apart, a yoga mat and pads beneath me. My uterus began pushing. I never pushed—not once. I just surrendered. I vocalized. It was primal.

Not once did I think, *This hurts too much. I can’t do this.* Yes, it hurt—but less than an inflamed ear or a toothache. It was intense—maybe 400x period pain, 600x constipation pain—but not frightening. It grew more familiar with every wave.

Then came a brief psychedelic moment. I saw a stone altar in a cave. Female voices asked: *What do you offer?* I answered: “Earth and air.” They accepted it, and gave me a small ball of fire.

When I opened my eyes, the penultimate surge came. D. was ready to catch the baby. When her head was out, I felt her pulse on my body. She rotated.

Then—an explosion. She slipped out of me and into the world, landing gently on the pads.

I held her close. Everything made sense.

D. moved me to the toilet for the placenta to come out into a pot.

One last thing: during the entire pregnancy and birth, I didn’t allow a single vaginal exam. No dilation checks. Nothing.

I trusted my body. I trusted my baby. That was enough.

A. was born around 3 p.m., weighing 3.8 kg and measuring 52 cm.
