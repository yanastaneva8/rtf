When I was pregnant with my first in 2011, I was just the same as most first-time mums:
 
Overjoyed to be expecting, but terrified at the thought of birth!!
 
All I’d ever heard were stories of how excruciatingly painful birth was, the tearing, the stitches, the problems after...
 
I know some women choose a caesarean birth to try to avoid this, but I knew that this wasn't an easy route - I’d had similar abdominal surgery to remove ovarian cysts as a teenager so understood first hand how painful it is post-op (even with the heavy pain meds), a catheter to pee, barely able to hold your baby never mind enjoy your baby. 
 
Nope, I knew that wasn’t how I wanted to spend those precious first few days with my baby, I wanted to be as healthy and well as possible so I could truly enjoy getting to know my new baby. And I knew this meant preparing for as natural and gentle a birth as possible.
 
So I threw myself into all things birth - learning everything there was to know about having a gentle, easeful birth - the physiology of birth, the impact of different environments on birth, breathing for birth, movement and body conditioning, hypnobirthing.
 
I literally read **ALL** the books, took **ALL** the courses, learned **ALL** the tools and techniques and **COMMITTED 110%** to my best birth.
 
The more I understood about the physiology of birth, I realised how important environment is. In the UK we are lucky to have the option to choose our place of birth, so I opted to have my baby at home as I knew this would give me the best chance to support a physiological birth.
 

As my due date approached, I experienced a few practice contractions - like strong period pain cramps, it was a great opportunity to practice breathing and moving through the sensations!
 
And after a few false starts, the big day finally came. I was 40+10 and it was the most intense, empowering and affirming experience!

I’d been at the midwife the day before and found out I was already 3cm dilated, so those practice contractions must have been doing something!
 
Six and a half hours from start to finish and a beautiful healthy 9lb 9oz baby boy born at 8.45am as the spring bird song welcomed him into my arms! 

## Birth Day

I’d woken in the small hours around 1am feeling cramping, and needing to go to the toilet. I stayed in the bathroom for the next hour or so and quite quickly the contractions became frequent and intense. 

I woke my partner so he could get the birth space in the living room ready.

I was surprised by how active I needed to be to manage the sensations - the most comfortable was on all fours leaning forward, rocking and swaying during the surges, and resting in child’s pose in-between. 

I also continued to spend quite a bit of time in the toilet, and a short while in the shower, but it was too uncomfortable standing. 

We called the midwife and she came around 5 or 6am. She asked what dilation I would be happy with. I said 5cm, given I’d been 3cm the day before. To my complete surprise she said I was 9.5cm!!

A few contractions later the sensations changed to more of a downward pressure. Intuitively, I felt I wanted to be more upright, kneeling on the floor and leaning into my partners lap while he sat on the sofa. 

With each surge I felt my baby move down the birth canal and start to crown, opening a little more with each contraction. It was full-body work, and after a while I started to feel tired, so I lay on my side for a few contractions to recuperate, then returned to kneeling into my partners lap. 

Apart from the vaginal examination, and intermittent monitoring of baby’s heart rate, the midwife was completely hands off and her unspoken faith in my body and its ability enabled me to stay in my birthing power and allowed my birthing hormones to flow freely.

Finally, the head was born! And with the next contraction, the body. The midwife guided my baby onto the floor and I sat back and admired him!  All 9lb 9oz of him! He was a beautiful little chubby buddha! I picked him up to my chest, leaned with my back against the sofa and we started our new life as a wee family!
 
Hard work? *Yes.* 
Painful? *No, but intense.* 
Gas and air? *No, didn’t feel I needed it at any point.* 
Tearing? *No.* 
Stitches? *No.* 
Would I do it again? **YES!** Just give me a week to recuperate and I’d love to go through the whole incredible experience again!
 
You may think:

> What?! Go through the whole experience again??!
> Yes - because my first birth made me realise our bodies are actually **PERFECTLY DESIGNED TO DO THIS**.
 
Without *excruciating pain*.
 
Without *damage*.
 
Without *medical interference*.
 
And it can even be a really beautiful, enjoyable and empowering experience! In fact, I believe this is how nature intends it to be. 

And honestly, I know there is **NO WAY** I would have had such a positive experience had I chosen a hospital birth. My endorphins would not have flowed in the same way and I think I would have been opting for an epidural on arriving at the hospital.

But being supported at home, in my own environment, meant my birthing hormones flowed without interruption, and my baby was born gently and easily.  

My birth experience was a hugely validating experience, bolstering confidence in myself and my capabilities as a mother. 

It is an experience I wish everything birthing mother could have. ✨
