With my first pregnancy I had no issues, and hypnobirthing techniques made my son’s birth a truly positive experience. Naturally, I hoped for the same again. Finding out I was pregnant came as quite a shock, but aside from a few migraines, sound sensitivity, and excess saliva, everything went smoothly — almost identical to my first.


At the 20-week scan, the sonographer told me I had a low-lying placenta. I had read about this before and knew it could move up, but I was still upset. After experiencing a homebirth once, I didn’t want that choice taken away. Over the weeks I found peace with the possibility of a planned C-section, knowing it could also be beautiful — I had heard so many wonderful stories. Still, I remained under the care of my homebirth team. At 36 weeks I was told the placenta had moved enough, and I was elated to aim for another homebirth.


I kept backup plans in case things didn’t unfold as I hoped, but everything went well apart from some lightning crotch. I was **"all bump"** this time, and although everyone said he’d be small, his growth measured fine. As my due date arrived, I had already made it clear I didn’t want induction or sweeps. I got a sweet message from my homebirth team reminding me to keep in touch, as my assigned midwife Irene was away on holiday. (Somehow both my babies were born when she was on leave — and she was so sad to miss them!)


On the late evening of October 2nd, three days past my due date, I was batch-cooking — a curry and some poached pears — when I suddenly felt labour beginning. I told my partner C.:

> I think it’s happening. 

Our son was asleep, I switched on the [TENS machine](https://www.nhs.uk/tests-and-treatments/transcutaneous-electrical-nerve-stimulation-tens/) (which I had loved the first time, and this time I started even earlier, which was such a help), and I carried on cooking to keep the oxytocin flowing. We lit incense, dimmed the lights, put on music, and enjoyed chatting in our own calm space. Breathing techniques and the wave comb helped me through contractions. I even ate the curry and pears for extra energy.

As things ramped up, I texted the on-call midwife, Helen, who arrived around 2:40 a.m. My birth plan requested checks only if I asked, and I chose to have one. I was 3 cm dilated, stretching to 7 cm, and Helen felt the baby would come soon. I leaned on affirmations and the [Freya app](https://thepositivebirthcompany.com/freya-hypnobirthing-app?srsltid=AfmBOooZowqQ2gJH25s0I4IwyaAso-Veq1Gl-TsXtnXzB_1UIKrmk6s1), which kept me focused and gave me a rhythm of progress.


The dilation phase was incredibly fast and intense. I went from 3 to 10 cm in about 30 minutes, while C. hurriedly filled the pool. My waters broke just as I got into the water. I assumed an upright, forward-leaning position, as I had with my first birth. C.’s encouragement — telling me I was doing it — helped more than he knew.

Helen supported me exactly as I’d asked: hands off, trusting me to follow my body. Her calm voice guided me when I roared and then shifted into down breathing. I tried a few puffs of gas and air but soon realised I didn’t need it.


Transition — the stage I’d really felt the first time — passed almost unnoticed because everything was happening so quickly. My baby’s head was born with two contractions. I thought I’d have a pause before the shoulders, but another contraction came almost immediately. Helen asked if I felt another surge and reminded me to listen to my body. The urge to push was overwhelming, almost involuntary. Instinctively, I shifted my leg out and relaxed my jaw, and my body seemed to open.


Suddenly, his whole body slipped out in one movement. Helen asked me to reach down and catch him myself — and I lifted my baby to my chest. Perfect. I kept repeating, 

> I did it, I did it! 

— it felt surreal that one moment he was in my belly and the next in my arms. My darling E. was born at 3:33 a.m. ⭐️

After delayed cord clamping, my placenta was born about 20 minutes later. We moved to the sofa for our golden hour while the midwives checked us both. Just shy of 9 lbs, he was a big, healthy boy, and I had no tearing. He had passed a little meconium during birth, but because he was still partially in his sac, it wasn’t a concern. I was offered a transfer to hospital, but I instinctively knew we were fine, and the midwives agreed.


Looking back, I know that without discovering hypnobirthing — through [Positive Birth](https://thepositivebirthcompany.com) and other resources — I wouldn’t have had the confidence to shape my birth the way I wanted. I had written plans for every scenario, because I believe all birth routes are beautiful, but the knowledge and tools I had meant I could approach each possibility with calm and strength.


✨ My second homebirth was fast, powerful, and filled with love. A story I’ll carry with me forever. ✨
