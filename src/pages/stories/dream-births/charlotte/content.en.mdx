Being a midwife within the [NHS](https://www.nhs.uk) comes with so much joy but also so many challenges. The service is so strapped, yet the midwives work their absolutely hardest to look after women with compassion and care. Unfortunately so much of the time women and babies are left traumatised and battered emotionally and physically due to the cascade of intervention that so many of them sadly end up on. I knew when I fell pregnant I had to do everything I could to have my baby at home, if it remained the safest place to do so. 

**Having a baby at home for your first birth is a very safe option and leads to less interventions and therefore often less traumatic for both you and baby.**

I had a very straight forward pregnancy, was a busy bee on my feet a lot as a continuity midwife and we didnâ€™t find out the gender of our baby so had a wonderful surprise to look forward to!

Iâ€™d had some evenings of thinking things were starting and tracked some contractions/tightening but always went to bed and work still pregnant!

The day and night things started at 40+1:

We had been for a decent length walk around our local parks but no signs of labour. We went up to bed like normal around 9pm and at 10pm I went to the bathroom before trying to get some sleep. As I wiped there was a huge gloopy bloody show on the tissue, I thought to myself this could be it, but also knew it could be a few days as I had no other signs. As I thought this and told my husband, mild contractions began! I told him if Iâ€™m not in bed when he wakes in the night, Iâ€™d be downstairs and Iâ€™d call him if I needed him. I stayed in bed for a few hours to try rest and I was contracting 1-2 in 10mins.

Around 2:30am things had intensified and contractions were more like 3-4 in 10mins, signs of labour establishing, so I grabbed my birth comb and waddled downstairs to continue labouring but to not disrupt my husbands sleep as who knows how long labour would be and I needed him on good form for the day!

By 6am my contractions had been consistently 3-4 in every 10mins and I was feeling I needed some support from my husband and a hot bath. I woke him up and run myself a bath. He kept busy downstairs doing some chores but because I didnâ€™t believe things were progressing so quickly I told him not to fill the birth pool yet but that he could pump it up. Along with this he put the dishwasher and washing machine on, things we would later realise werenâ€™t the best things to do when weâ€™d be needing lots of hot water soon!

By 7:30am I was feeling intense pressure at the height of contractions, still in denial that I was in established labour, but decided it would be a good idea to call the maternity labour line. They agreed to send out the community midwives, who covered homebirths as no actual homebirth team in the trust I was cared under.

Around 8:15am the first midwife arrived, I consented to a vaginal examination after the midwife had completed her routine checks (around 8:30am) as I still wasnâ€™t convinced this was it. She said my amniotic sac was bulging making the examination hard to do but she said I was definitely more than 4cm, I think I was close to fully dilated and she couldnâ€™t find any cervix but she never told me this. In this moment I just wanted to rest on my side but the midwife encouraged me to remain mobile. All while I was upstairs being examined my husband realised he had sent the boiler into overdrive, me having just had a hot bath, him putting the dishwasher and washing machine on, and so there was now no hot water as the overflow had thrown what hot water we had left out of the side of the house! ðŸ˜³

I told him not to worry but he was busy trying to heat up the pool with pans of water - at this point it was measuring about 27 degrees and I knew in my mind we probably wouldnâ€™t be able to get it another 10 degrees hotter in time so I told him not to worry and to just support me.

I staggered downstairs between contractions and knelt over the side of the pool for support.

Around 10:30am I was beginning to feel quite pushy at the peak of contractions, a completely overwhelming feeling that I had no control over. During one peak of contraction, my waters broke! Nothing dramatic, but I could feel them leaking into the sanitary pants I was wearing. Thin meconium was noted but as I was progressing quickly the midwives knew it was safer to stay at home at this point. The involuntary pushing continued and got even more intense. By 11am the midwives could see the top of babyâ€™s head peaking out, while on all fours leaning onto my husband who was sat on the sofa. The midwives suggested a position change after a handful of contractions to aid babyâ€™s descent so I ended up semi-recumbent leaning onto my husbandâ€™s legs as no other position felt feasible at that moment! 

At 11:28am my daughter, P. A., was born onto my tummy with the guidance of the midwife. As she emerged my pubic bone clicked, an awful pain that shocked us all, but made sense as Iâ€™d had awful pelvic girdle pain during the third trimester.

I gave birth to the placenta about 15mins later, physiologically, even though the midwives did panic slightly when the separation bleed came out. However, I tugged at the cord and the placenta came away nicely moments later.

The community midwives assessed me for a tear, I had a 2nd degree that they didnâ€™t feel confident suturing at home so we made the call to pop into the hospital for suturing. Penelope was also mildly grunting, although all her observations were perfect after birth.

While in hospital we also had Penelopeâ€™s first checks, the [NIPE](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/newborn-and-infant-physical-examination-programme-handbook/newborn-and-infant-physical-examination-screening-programme-handbook), completed which made life easier all in all as then we didnâ€™t have to go back in the next day as community NIPEs werenâ€™t available unfortunately.

I highly recommend a homebirth to anyone who feels itâ€™s a good choice for them.
